<h1> Personal projects </h1>
<br>
<p> In this repository I will publish projects that I have worked on in my sparetime. For the moment I have two notebooks. 
  The first notebook regards a geospatial analysis about where to fish in Northern Norway based on tides and wind data. 
  The second notebook regards an advanced, in my opinion, portofolio analysis. First I optimize a portfolio containing x stocks,
  then I optimize this portofolio based on some parameter. Afterwards I replicate the portofolios movement and try to analysis it and create a multimodel recursive deep learning forecasting model.
